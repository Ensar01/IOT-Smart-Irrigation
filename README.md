## Project Description
 
The IOT Smart Irrigation project uses a Node-MCU ESP32, DHT11 sensor, soil moisture sensor, and a water pump for soil irrigation. The sensors collect data about soil moisture, air humidity, and air temperature, and store it in a Firebase database. The web application displays these values and allows users to operate the water pump. If the values exceed the allowed limits, the user receives an alert to turn off the pump; otherwise, they are alerted to turn on the pump. If the values are within the acceptable range, it displays that everything is functioning properly. The web application is responsive, allowing it to be used on various devices.
